      <description>Introduction Another year of Covid-19 and this time, India got hit even harder. And who should be blamed&amp;hellip; Let me see&amp;hellip; maybe it is the people who thought that how worse can the virus be&amp;hellip; Hold on&amp;hellip; it should definitely be government&amp;rsquo;s responsibility that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t contain the spread of the virus. Leave it!
 &amp;ldquo;‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§™‡§õ‡§§‡§æ‡§è ‡§π‡•ã‡§§ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ, ‡§ö‡§ø‡§°‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ö‡•Å‡§ó ‡§ó‡§à ‡§ñ‡•á‡§§&amp;rdquo;
 For the non-hindi speakers, it means there is no point in regreting late, when the action (birds spoiling the farm fields) has happened.</description>

      <description>Introduction I like knowing about weather. Discussing weather is good old technique which always gets one out of an awkward silent &amp;ldquo;conversation&amp;rdquo; üòâ.
In the very first episode, we will try show weather information in the bash prompt. The idea is simple:
 Find some API to get current weather data - preferably free! Learn how bash prompt work. Ideally, this should have been the first thing to do, but nevermind&amp;hellip; Write code to fetch weather data.</description>

      <description>So, the other day I sat down watching The Matrix. It‚Äôs comfortable and relaxing; everything‚Äôs going great.
The universal law of Conservation of Coziness comes to bite you!
If you are a realist, you can relate. Being comfortable for long is not possible. The longer you remain relaxed, the more you‚Äôll have to work your ass off later.
Okay, now going back to the story. I was relaxing and enjoying the great movie.</description>
