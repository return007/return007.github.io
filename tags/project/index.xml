      <description>Introduction Another year of Covid-19 and this time, India got hit even harder. And who should be blamed&amp;hellip; Let me see&amp;hellip; maybe it is the people who thought that how worse can the virus be&amp;hellip; Hold on&amp;hellip; it should definitely be government&amp;rsquo;s responsibility that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t contain the spread of the virus. Leave it!
 &amp;ldquo;अब पछताए होत क्या, चिडिया चुग गई खेत&amp;rdquo;
 For the non-hindi speakers, it means there is no point in regreting late, when the action (birds spoiling the farm fields) has happened.</description>

      <description>So, the other day I sat down watching The Matrix. It’s comfortable and relaxing; everything’s going great.
The universal law of Conservation of Coziness comes to bite you!
If you are a realist, you can relate. Being comfortable for long is not possible. The longer you remain relaxed, the more you’ll have to work your ass off later.
Okay, now going back to the story. I was relaxing and enjoying the great movie.</description>
